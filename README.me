1. To monitor The spread of the disease and pattern spread.
2. To classify various stages of the disease based on symptoms.
3. To predict future spread of the disease based on the distribution and monitoring.
4. To identify trends based on seasonal conditions

    Infection and Incubation Stage:
        Infection: Cattle become infected when bitten by ticks carrying Theileria sporozoites.
        Incubation Period: The sporozoites enter the bloodstream and invade lymphocytes, where they multiply. This stage lasts about 7-25 days depending on the species of Theileria and the immune status of the host.

    Acute Stage:
        Lymphoproliferative Phase: The infected lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion, causing lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes).
        Pyrexia (Fever): Cattle develop high fever, often exceeding 40°C (104°F).
        Anorexia and Lethargy: Animals show a loss of appetite and become lethargic.
        Respiratory Signs: Difficulty in breathing and coughing may occur due to pulmonary edema and pleural effusion.

    Piroplasm Stage:
        Erythrocytic Phase: The parasite invades red blood cells, forming piroplasms.
        Anemia: Destruction of red blood cells leads to anemia, characterized by pale mucous membranes and weakness.
        Jaundice: Hemolysis can result in jaundice, evidenced by yellowing of the mucous membranes and eyes.

    Chronic Stage:
        Weight Loss and Poor Condition: Chronic cases may show prolonged weight loss, emaciation, and poor general condition.
        Mild Anemia: Persistent but less severe anemia compared to the acute stage.
        Recovery or Carrier State: Some animals may recover, while others become carriers of the parasite, harboring low levels of the parasite without showing clinical signs.

    Reproductive Issues:
        Abortion: Pregnant cows may abort due to the stress and systemic effects of the disease.
        Infertility: Chronic infection can lead to reproductive issues such as infertility.
